# Rain-bow

This is a simple go program that draws rainbow lines that fall from the top of
the window to the bottom.  I wrote it as a toy to learn about channels and
[pixel](https://github.com/faiface/pixel) graphics programming.

While the animation is running you can press `spacebar` to pause, `right arrow`
to add a drop, and `left arrow` to remove a drop.
